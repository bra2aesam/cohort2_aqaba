    <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.

    Jack would really like...</p>
    
    <ul>
       <li>Roller blades</li> 
       <li>Magic tricks</li>
       <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
</ul>
You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus.com</a>  and <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/"> eToys.</a>
